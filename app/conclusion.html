          <p>While learning and subsequently teaching how to use Yeoman has been a fun time, it 
          wasn't without hiccups. Let's address some of these problems now, just in case you 
          experience them as well</P>
          <ul>
            <li>npm</li><p>During debugging, you will occasionally come across an error where a certain
            package is missing and the build command will abort. If this is the case, then your day 
            is far from completely ruined. grunt gives some excellent feedback as to what you're 
            exactly missing. Google for the specific package name, and install it. For example, during
            the production of the demonstration site, the imagemin.js library was missing. In order to
            fix this, I simple typed
            <img src="images/028.png">
            This prompted node project manager to search out the specific library missing from my build
            and download it.
            <li>Grunt</li><p>Grunt is, in my opinion, the most powerful of the three tools. In this 
            guide today, we only examined 3 Grunt commands. However, Grunt can do so much more. For
            example, if you were to just declare 'grunt' versus 'grunt test', then grunt will run a 
            test and build of every portion of the folder. This can create problems with more general
            projects; if by default you have included certain .js objects, they may cause errors
            during the build. The grunt solution is to add '--force' to the grunt command. A safer
            alternative is to simply use 'grunt build', as specified in this guide.</p>
            <li>Root Location</li><p>Yeoman searches out yo-rc.json as it's root folder. This means
            that it will search as deep as it can until this is found. When it's found, that folder
            becomes the root directory. What does this mean for you? It means that created a yeoman
            project within a sub-folder of a yeoman project will initialize the root folder as the 
            new project, not your intended location. Be careful!</p>
            <li>Minify</li><p>When Grunt compresses your websites files for the live version,
            some changes happen. One of the more interesting changes occurs thanks to grunt-usemin.
            To disable this, open</p>
            <p class="bg-info">Gruntfile.js</p>
            <img src="images/036.png">
            <p>In this file, delete:
            <p class="bg-info">'cssmin'</br>'htmlmin'</br>'uglify'</p>
            Cssmin minify's your css code, htmlmin your html code, and uglify your js.</p>            
            <li>Usemin</li><p>This grunt plug-in minimizes your html, js, and css files. It also 
            rewrites image names into a hashable search for a faster website. However, if your img 
            links are absolute links, this will create problems.</p>
            <li>Relative URLs</li><p>Similar to the image problems with usemin, when writing urls,
            I found it more effective to link via relative urls versus absolute urls. For example,
            <p class="bg-info">href="/prepareContent.html"</p>
            Make problems for my website and would not link properly, instead redirecting the user
            to the absolute root.
            <p class="bg-info">href="prepareContent.html"</p>
            A relative url did not. The "/" made all the difference.
            </p>
          </ul>
          <p>Yeoman is a fantastic tool for eliminating so much of the work process. It really 
          allows someone to just dive in and begin making agile websites quickly and efficiently. 
          Mind you, this guide was only meant to serve as an introduction to Yeoman. With added 
          knowledge of angular-js, jquery, bootstrap, SASS, and more, itâ€™s possible to expand your 
          website in any direction.</p>
          <p>In fact, this guide you're currently viewing was created through the tools offered by
          Yeoman!</p>
